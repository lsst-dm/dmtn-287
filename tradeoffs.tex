\section{General cloud benefits and drawbacks} \label{sec:tradeoffs}

One of the major advantages of this approach is the separation of security concerns, users  SLAC require extra checks which take some time because it is a DOE facility.
SLAC may have difficulty processing accounts  for  our many thousands of users since their process is somewhat lengthy.
By putting all the science users on Google we can streamline access using InCommon \footnote{\url{https://incommon.org/}} which will allow us to identify most US academic users.

We have found Google during the data preview very performant and reliable - we may give up some of this hosting the image data at SLAC.
In our first SLAC year we have had some data loss and some scaling issues.

A major plus for on prem in this instance is the backing of DOE - this is what they want and there is commitment to making it work.
