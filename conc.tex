\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will come into operations in 2025.
The Rubin US data facility, hosted at SLAC, stores the Rubin data and processes it in conjunction with out French and UK partner facilities.

We have already run most of our scientist facing services on Google for three years.
We currently support one thousand users on the science platform hosted on google and are preparing for the many thousands of more users Rubin expects.

Transition to a hybrid model with the bulk of the data stored on premises at SLAC but maintaining the scientist facing services on Google is underway.
