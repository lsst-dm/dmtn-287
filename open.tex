\section{Open Issues} \label{sec:open}

We have not yet tested the client server butler between SLAC and Google.
We have checked the bandwidth and latency is acceptable but it remains to be seen how it will work under load.

Butler implements a client cache  so a scientists notebook or script  repeatedly accessing the same image will be well handled.
But for the cloud connections we consider a general cache for images,  this would only work if many scientists use the same image.
We do not know the image access patterns that will occur in operations and hence are not sure if this will work or perhaps the client cache is adequate.


We need to investigate how to get a  consolidated view of key metrics and monitoring across the cloud and on-premise.
Such a view would help immensely in tracking down issues which may appear in one part while the cause is elsewhere.

For user batch we have specified users would have to have SLAC accounts and log in to SLAC to submit jobs \cite{DMTN-223}.
It would be user friendly to allow submission of batch jobs directly from the cloud hosted science platform which execute on SLAC.
In principle we can do this but there are issues ranging from time allocation at SLAC and viewing of results which are not yet resolved.
